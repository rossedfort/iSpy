# Contributor Guidelines

### Style Guide

iSpy follows the standard 'react-app' JavaScript styleguide that ships with create-react-app. You'll see lint warnings in the console while developing. Please fix them ðŸ™Œ

### Pull Requests

Before you submit your Pull Request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/rossedfort/iSpy/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Fork the repo
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Create your patch.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows standard commit message conventions.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `iSpy:master`.
* Make sure you follow the Pull Request Template

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
